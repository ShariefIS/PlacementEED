						<p>My Dear Students ,<br>I would like to share some of the Servie Now’s cracking tips and tricks with you. But my strong advise to you all is to be prepared thoroughly for all the topics related to aptitude and essay writing.

<h3>1st Round:</h3><br>
MCQ test consisting of 30 questions to be done in 30 minutes with from topics like Trees, Graphs, SQL, Data bases, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems & Computer Networks.<br>
In short Technical questions will be mostly from all core subjects including 5 to 7 quantitative aptitude questions. (30 questions: 30 Minute) (cutoff may be : 25+ out of 30).<br>
<br>
<h3>2nd Round: (45 minutes)</h3><br>
<b>Set-1 questions </b><br>
1. AVL tree balance checking.<br>
2. Median of 2 sorted arrays in O(log N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.<br>
3. Strings Anagram in O(1) space complexity<br>
4. Level order traversal of a tree using Queue.<br>
5. Reverse level order traversal of a tree using Queue.<br>
6. BFS and DFS Difference.<br>
7. OS Concepts – Starvation, Demand Paging, Virtual Memory, Deadlocks<br>
<b>Set-2 questions</b><br>
   1. Describe internship work.<br>
   2. What is the solution to the problem with 100 storeys and 2 eggs?-refer attached document for solution <br>
   3. How do we find count of numbers between (a,b) both inclusive with no consecutive ones in the binary representation? They asked me 3 different approaches for this problem.<br>
     4. Difference between object oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming ?<br>
     5. A question about builder pattern where I had to create a pizza having veg or non-veg crust , different sauce topping , different crust draw the class diagram and write a code calculating total cost?<br>
     6. Difference between abstract class and interface what is the problem if I use abstract class when there are no implemented methods?<br>
     7. If a variable is protected in parent class and another variable with same name with public is declared in child class is this allowed is the reverse also allowed and how would you access parents variable in child class?<br>
     8. Detecting a loop in a singly linked list what are the stopping condition if there is no loop?<br>
     9. In a circularly linked list how would you ensure at least one node is left always even if you remove all the nodes ? Ans :insert a dummy node at the start.<br>
     <b>Set-3 Questions</b><br>
1. Space and time complexity to “Detecting a Loop in a Singly Linked List ” .<br>
2. Executable Code to Detect a Loop in a Singly Linked List without any mistake in first time with all boundry cases if any.<br>
3. If i were you i would have implemented Floyd’s cycle for finding algorithm so he might ask me a question to drive a mathematical expresson in terms of variable and why this algorithm works and so on........<br>
<br>

<h3>3rd Round: (45 minutes)</h3><br>

<b>Set-1 Questions</b><br>
1. Find product of each element of an array except that element in O(N) time complexity without using / operation.<br>
2. Recursively deleting linked list.<br>
3. Recursively deleting linked list from end<br>
4. Recursively deleting tree<br>
5. Recursively deleting from end<br>
6. Difference between Floyd Warshall and Djikstra.<br>
7. Shortest path between 2 points in 2-D space in O(log N) time.<br>

<b>Set-2 Questions</b> <br>
1. what is microprocessor ?<br>
2. what is microcontroller ?<br>
3. what is the difference between microprocessor and microcontroler ?<br>
give an example for each and what is intel i7 ?<br>
4. difference between functional and oo approach of problem solving .<br>
why oops is best.<br>
5. The Three Door Puzzle.<br>
6. Program to convert a given number into words<br>
(ex: input -197 ; output : ONE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN).<br>
<br>
<b>Set-3 Questions</b> <br>

1. Given a container and 3 shapes of balls small , medium , large using each type of ball at least once how do you fit these balls so that the space wasted is minimized (The interviewer will be looking for a programmatic way of solving the problem<br>
 2. How to reduce the time of booting of the processor where we have no control on hardware devices but can only modify software (The interviewer will be looking for more points here)?<br>
 3. There are 9 balls one ball is lighter out of them and we have a balance how would you find lighter ball in 2 weightings? (The interviewer will be looking for what you will not be able do or answer)?<br>
 4. a question on whether any front end design projects have been done by you in your internship/projects/extracurricular  if any as mentioned by you in your CV’s.<br>



 <h3>4th Round: (30 minutes)</h3><br>
<br>
<b>Set-1 Questions</b>><br>
1. Design a system for putting newspapers using classes and functions taking different aspects into account.<br>
2. SQL commands.<br>
3. Machine learning concepts: Clustering, SVM<br>

<b>Set-2 Questions </b><br>
1. Generate all circular prime numbers from 1 to 10,000 .<br>
( A number is called circular prime if all the numbers formed by using the digits of that number are prime .<br>
ex: 17-71, 13->31 , ….)<br>
— > First he told me to write it on paper As I did It in 5 minute he told me to write the code on an online compiler as it is.<br>
<br>
<b>Set-3 Questions</b> <br>
May be repeated from set-1 and set-2 questions for this round <br>

<h3>5th Round- HR</h3><br>

Simple HR questions will be asked (kind of formality).<br>

For example <br>

General HR questions like Introduce yourself, Why would you want to join Service Now, Where do you see yourself after 5 years?<br>
The most important thing you should have within you is Confidence.<br>
Everybody says yes I am confident but I think not really .<br>
The second thing is dont bluff in anything what you dont know .<br>
<b>" BE YOURSELF. "</b><br>
<br>
<a style="color: #2b542c;" href="dynamicprg.html">Some solutions and tip's on Dynamic Programming.</a>

<p><br>Finally All the Best!
<br>I hope some of my strategies, tips and tricks may help you to boost up your Confidence level to crack it and if you need any further clarifications and assistance you can contact me any time also i have attached a sample mock test aptitude papers and sample questions to practice. I strongly advise you all to prepare all the other topics also which are not mentioned in this so that you are on safe side.
<br>Wish you the BEST.
