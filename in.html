						<p>My Dear Students ,<br>Merit Track is the company which conducts online test for Infosys. In online test there are 3 sections Aptitude, English, Reasoning. There is sectional cutoff also in each section so be careful about that. The online test level is average aptitude and reasoning is simple but English needs good practice. After the online test interview take place. The entire process is quite easy.</p>

						
						<p> Online test has 3 categories.<br>
							1. Reasoning - 15 questions 25 minutes.<br>
							2. Aptitude - 10 questions 35 minutes. <br>
							3. Verbal - 40 questions 35 minutes.<br>

<p>The main areas of the test are as follows.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Test-Section I/Arithmetic Reasoning and Analytical Thinking - 25 minutes - 15 questions.</b><br>

- Data interpretation - 5 questions.(This section consists of a direct sequence of 5 questions based on the data which is provided in the form of table charts, bar charts, pie charts or line charts)
 
<br>- Syllogisms - 5 questions. (This section consists of statement followed by two conclusions. you need to pick out from 5 options which suits the best answer)<br>

- Data sufficiency - 5 questions.<br>

(Here a set of two statements are given followed by 5 options which satisfy the answer for the statements. You have to decide which option best suits the answer)
note you can use R.S aggarwal book to prepare for this section
 <br>
<br><u>Strategy</u>: Attempt Individual questions first, like questions from Syllogism, Data Sufficiency, Data interpretation. Because these questions will not have common data to be solved and each question might take a maximum of 2 minutes to solve and a majority can be solved in less than a minute. You can easily solve 9 such questions with-in first 15 Minutes. Now you will be left with Data Arrangement and Data Interpretation type of questions and I recommend you to solve data Arrangement at the end because there is high probability of getting it wrong compared to Data Interpretation. Hence out of the remaining 10 Minutes even if you get 2 to 3 questions correct you will comfortably clear the expected cut-off.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>2. Test-Section II/ Mathematical Critical Thinking and Logical Reasoning - 35 minutes - 10 questions.</b>
 
<br>For this section the focus is more on Numbers and Advance concepts like Permutation and Combination, Probability. Few questions from topics like Time and Work, Time Speed and Distance (boat & train), age problem, profit, loss, percentages.
Along with this one or two Cryptarithmetic Questions. These questions are usually time consuming to solve. Since there will be options given for these questions it makes these questions solvable with-in the available time.
 
<br>The 10 questions can be divided as follows
<br>- Permutation and Combination, probability – 3 to 5 questions. Like seating arrangement
<br>- Alligation or Mixture - 1 question.
<br>- Number series - 1 question. Like 7th number in the series....99,18,36,9,18
<br>- Cryptarithmetic – 1 or 2 questions. Like AGE+AGE=GOAL find OO+AA=?
<br>-  time and work-1 question like  If A and B can do a piece of work in 7.5 days……….
<br>-Time,speed and distance-1 question like boats and trains
 <br>
<br><u>Strategy</u>: Focus on getting 6 Questions correct by choosing the less time consuming questions and attempt it with-in the first 15 Minutes. You will notice 3 to 4 very easy questions which can be solved in less than 5 minutes. Once you are through with this then you will have close to 20 Minutes for the remaining 4 questions and out of which even if you get 1 question correct you will most likely clear the expected cut-off. Hence the key here is to identify the 6 less time consuming questions.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>3. Test Section III/Test of Communicative English - 35 minutes - 40 questions.</b>
 
<br>40 Questions testing almost all the areas of Verbal that is Grammar, Comprehension, Vocabulary and Critical Reasoning, 10 Questions each.

<br>The Verbal Ability test pattern of 40 questions is distributed into 5 different topics as:
 
<br>1. SENTENCE CORRECTION (8 questions): Among 4 sentences the correct one should be detected
 
<br>2. Underlined part of sentence and asked to insert correct phrase in it from the given 4 options (8 questions)
 
<br>3. Fill in the blanks (8 questions)
 
<br>4. Theme Detection (6 questions)
 
<br>5. Two reading comprehensions (10 questions)
 <br>
<br><u>Strategy:</u>
There will be very less time for verbal section, so do it fast just read the question once but carefully n give the answer...there is no time of reading the question twice..
Attempt Sentence Correction or Error Spotting and Vocabulary first, that is with-in first 15 Minutes try to complete these 20 Questions. Next go for Reading Comprehension and here if you find a lengthy passage then you will get 2 to 3 direct questions hence read the question first and try to find the answer from the passage. Don’t try to read and understand the passage completely. You can comfortably attempt only the direct questions with-in 5 minutes and take a chance in the other type of questions since there is no negative marks. Don’t waste your time in inference type of questions. If you get a short passage better attempt it at the end because the questions will be tougher. You will get at-least one lengthy passage hence you can attempt that first. Last type of question may be from Critical Reasoning try to attempt 5 to 6 questions with-in 10 Minutes. By now you would have attempted close to 30 questions in 30 Minutes and with an accuracy of 85% you will easily clear the cut-off and you still have 5 Minutes left to attempt the remaining questions</p>

<p><br>Finally All the Best!
<br>I hope some of my strategies, tips and tricks may help you to boost up your Confidence level to crack it and if you need any further clarifications and assistance you can contact me any time. I strongly advise you all to prepare all the other topics also which are not mentioned in this so that you are on safe side.
<br>Wish you the BEST.
